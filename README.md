# CRAINE
Craine Rocks Although It's Not Emacs

This is a text editor that is a fork of Emacs. 
Purpose of this text editor is to be similar to Emacs but simpler. 
No real reason for its existence to be honest. 
Not even better than Emacs, its quite literally in the name. 

I suppose the reason for its existence is to really just make me feel better about myself. 
Like, hey I forked a text editor!

Why you ask? 
Well..... I dunno. 

Stay posted. 

Or Don't. 

I don't really care
